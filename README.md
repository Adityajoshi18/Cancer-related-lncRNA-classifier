# Cancer-related-lncRNA-classifier
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely involved in the initiation and development of cancer. Although some computational methods have been proposed to identify cancer-related lncRNAs, there is still a demanding to improve the prediction accuracy and efficiency. In addition, the quick-update data of cancer, as well as the discovery of new mechanism, also underlay the possibility of improvement of cancer-related lncRNA prediction algorithm. In this study, we introduced CRlncRC, a novel Cancer-Related lncRNA Classifier by integrating many features with five machine-learning techniques.



# Features
85 features in 4 categories (genomic, epigenetic, expression, network).

# Best Model
Six learning techniques were used to develop the effective classification model including Random Forest (RF), Na√Øve bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost.Used ensemble learning method of Stacking to combine the performances of the base machine learning models to get more accurate results.
